# refutils
The point of this repository is
to provide utilities for managing scientific references
from the command line.
It is also meant to replace Mendeley,
which I have used on and off for a couple years,
but I have never been very satisfied with it.
My main complaints about Mendeley are
- to view a PDF with my highlights/comments,
  I have to open a website or application that is much heavier
  than a simple PDF viewer;
- a while ago I tried having Mendeley Desktop on both Windows and Ubuntu,
  and somehow my library got corrupted and syncing stopped working
  (I don't remember all the details because it has been a while),
  and since then I have always been worried that Mendeley will break again;
  and
- I didn't make it :)
  (while this is somewhat facetious,
  one result is that I can't easily debug when things go wrong
  like in the previous point).
My aim is to overcome these limitations
and provide a clean command line interface
for easily managing references.
